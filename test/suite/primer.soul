# This is a variable declaration.
# It is immutable by default.
let my_variable : i32 = 540;

# Mutable variables are declared like so:
let mut my_variable : i32 = 540;
my_variable = 250; # Can be reasigned.

# Basic types: i32, i64, f32, f64, str, char, void (functions), <struct>, <enum>

# Enums are declared like this:
enum MyEnum
{
    Terran,
    Zerg,
    Gay,
}

# Structs are composite types and are declared like so:
struct MyStruct
{
	health     : i32;
	health_max : i32;
	mana       : i32;
	mana_max   : i32;
}

# Function definition
fn my_function() :: void { }

# ... parentheses can be skipped if the function takes no params.
fn my_function :: void { }

# Calling functions
fn main :: void
